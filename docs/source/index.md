# Introduction

`dlite` creates `Web Components` and interactive web pages easily without the bloat of big frameworks. It can be effortlessly added into existing HTML pages to create reusable components for web applications. `dlite` is perfect for simple, but dynamic static sites or when you want to progressively enhance a site without changing too much HTML.
